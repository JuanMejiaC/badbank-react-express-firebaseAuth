## Description
  This project was started as part of the Professional Certificate in Coding from MITxPro. I contains the starter code to build a banking application with the MERN stack.

## How to Run
      To run it you need to:
        *Clone or donwload it.
        *Install all the dependencies by running **npm init** in the command line.
        *This project uses firebase Client SDK AND Admin SDK, so you have to create a firebase account and set the appropiate configurations. You are going to need to create 2 files: config.js and serviceAccountKey.json and paste the configuration and key provided by your firebase account.
        *Once all the setting are configured run it from the command line with **node index.js**

## Technology Used

    * Node
    * Express
    * Mongo

  I will continue developing it to become a full fledge banking application.
